# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email FANT0004@e.ntu.edu.sg to report security vulnerabilities.

We use this email for our intake and triage. For valid issues, we will do coordination and disclosure here on GitHub (including using a GitHub Security Advisory when necessary).

Our Team will process your report within a day, and respond within a week (although it will depend on the severity of your report).
